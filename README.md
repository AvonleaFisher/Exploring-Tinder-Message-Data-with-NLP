# Exploring-Tinder-Message-Data-with-NLP
<b>Author:</b> Avonlea Fisher
## Introduction
The contents of this repository explore message data from my Tinder account with Natural Language Processing. Users can request a copy of their personal data, which is made available to them via e-mail in a JSON format, using the [Download my Data](https://www.help.tinder.com/hc/en-us/articles/115005626726-How-do-I-request-a-copy-of-my-personal-data-) tool. Due to the personal nature of user data, the JSON file used in this analysis is not included in this repository. 

## Methods
A list of message strings was created from the data, cleaned, and converted into a list of words that excluded stopwords. This list was used to create a that visualized the individual words that occured most frequently in the message corpus:
